What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>It is said to be the home of a monster.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Do you think it's true?</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td> Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Yes. Couldn't you tell? </td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>McGonagall's worried. </td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>All the teachers are.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... </td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. </td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>The question is, who is it?</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Let's think. </td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>If you're talking about Malfoy...</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Of course. You heard him.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>You'll be next, Mudbloods.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>I heard him.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I mean, look at his family.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Crabbe and Goyle must know.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Maybe we could trick them into telling.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Even they aren't that thick.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>But there might be another way.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Mind you, it would be difficult.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>and it'll be dangerous.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Very dangerous.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Here it is.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>The Polyjuice Potion.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Yes </td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Exactly.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>But it's tricky. </td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>I've never seen a more complicated potion.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>How long will it take to make?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>A month.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>A month?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>But, Hermione,</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>I know.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>But it's the only plan we've got.</td></tr><tr><td>LEE JORDAN</td><td>Another goal for Slytherin!</td></tr><tr><td>LEE JORDAN</td><td>They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.</td></tr><tr><td>SLYTHERINS</td><td>Yeah! Yeah!</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>All right there, Scarhead?</td></tr><tr><td>WOOD</td><td>Watch yourself, Harry!</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Wood, look out!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>That's been tampered with, that has.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>I'll stop it.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>You could hit Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Training for the ballet, Potter!!</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>You'll never catch me, Potter.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Let's go.</td></tr><tr><td>LEE JORDAN</td><td>Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.</td></tr><tr><td>LEE JORDAN</td><td>Gryffindor wins!</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Finite Incantatem!</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Are you okay?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>No. I think my arm is broken.</td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>Not to worry, Harry. </td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>I will fix that arm of yours straight away.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>No, Not you.</td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>Boy doesn't know what he's saying.</td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>This won't hurt a bit.</td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>Brackium Emendo!</td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>Yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Broken? There's no bones left.</td></tr><tr><td>GILDEROY LOCKHART</td><td>Much more flexible, though.</td></tr><tr><td>MADAM POMFREY</td><td>Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.</td></tr><tr><td>MADAM POMFREY</td><td>You can go.

The Grim.</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>Taking form of a giant spectral dog.</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>It's among the darkest omens in our world.</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>It's an omen of death.\"\"</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>A fair few.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Hang on. That's not possible.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>You have to be in two classes at once.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Less talking, if you don't mind.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>I got a real treat for you today.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>A great lesson. So follow me.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Right, you lot. Less chattering.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Form a group over there.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>And open your books to page 49.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Exactly how do we do that?</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Just stroke the spine, of course.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Goodness me.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>I'm okay. Okay.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>I think they're funny.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Shut up, Malfoy.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Dementor! Dementor!</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Just ignore him.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>You're supposed to stroke it.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>Yeah.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Tah- tah- tah- dah! Isn't he beautiful?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Say hello to Buckbeak.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Hagrid, exactly what is that?</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>That, Ron, is a hippogriff.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Very easily offended.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>You do not want to insult a hippogriff.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>It may be the last thing you ever do.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Now, who'd like to come and say hello?</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Well done, Harry. Well done.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Come on now.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Now you have to let him make the first move. </td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>It's only polite. So step up. Give him a nice bow.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Then you wait and see if he bows back.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>If he does, you can go and touch him.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>If not... Well, we'll get to that later.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Just make your bow.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Nice and low.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Back off, Harry. Back off.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Keep still. Keep still.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Well done, Harry. Well done.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Here, you big brute, you.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Right. I think you can go and pat him now.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Go on. Don't be shy.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Nice and slow, now.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Nice and slow. Slow.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Not so fast, Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Slow down, Harry. That's it...</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Nice and slow.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Now let him come to you.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>That's it…Yes!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Well done! Well done, Harry,</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>well done!</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>Does he get to fly?</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>I think he may let you ride him now.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>What?</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Come on.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Hey, hey, hey!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. </td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>That was wicked, Harry!</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Oh, please.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Well done, well done.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>How am I doing me first day?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Brilliant, professor.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Malfoy, no...</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>No!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Buckbeak!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Whoa, whoa, whoa...</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Whoa! Buckbeak!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Away, you silly creature...</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>It's killed me!</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Calm down. It's just a scratch!</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>I'm the teacher. I'll do it.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>You're gonna regret this.</td></tr><tr><td>HAGRID</td><td>Class dismissed!</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>You and your bloody chicken!</td></tr><tr><td>PANSY PARKINSON</td><td>Does it hurt terribly, Draco?</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>It comes and it goes.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Still, I consider myself lucky.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>I can't do homework for weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Listen to the idiot.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>At least Hagrid didn't get fired.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>I hear Draco's father's furious.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>We haven't heard the end of this.</td></tr><tr><td>SEAMUS</td><td>He's been sighted!</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Who?</td></tr><tr><td>SEAMUS</td><td>Sirius Black!</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Dufftown? That's not far from here.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?</td></tr><tr><td>BOY</td><td>With dementors at every entrance?</td></tr><tr><td>SEAMUS</td><td>Dementors?</td></tr><tr><td>SEAMUS</td><td>He slipped past them once.</td></tr><tr><td>SEAMUS</td><td>Who's to say he won't do it again?</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>That's right. Black could be anywhere.</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>It's like trying to catch smoke.</td></tr><tr><td>BEM</td><td>Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Intriguing, isn't it?</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?</td></tr><tr><td>DEAN</td><td>That's a boggart, that is.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Very good, Mr. Thomas.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>No one knows.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>When did she get here?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Boggarts are shape-shifters.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>That's what makes them so...</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Let's practice it now.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Without wands, please.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>After me. Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>CLASS</td><td>Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Very good.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>A little louder and very clear.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Listen: Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>CLASS</td><td>Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>DRACO</td><td>This class is ridiculous.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Very good.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>So much for the easy part. </td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You see, the incantation alone is not enough.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>What really finishes a boggart is laughter.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. </td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Come on, don't be shy. Come on.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Come on.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>Professor Snape.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Sorry?</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>Professor Snape.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You live with your grandmother.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>Yes. I don't want it to turn into her, either.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>No it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>She carries a red handbag...</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>We don't need to hear.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>As long as you see it, we'll see it.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Can you do that?</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Yes. Wand at the ready.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>One, two, three.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Think, Neville, think.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Incredible! Okay to the back, Neville.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Everyone, form a line...</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Form a line!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Next! Ron!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Concentrate. Face your fear.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Be brave!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Wand at the ready, Ron.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Yes!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You see? Very good, very good!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Show us what you see.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Keep your nerve. Steady.</td></tr><tr><td>PARVATI</td><td>Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>And next! Step up, step up!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Wonderful, wonderful! Here!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Riddikulus!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Right. Sorry about that.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>That's enough for today.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Collect your books from the back.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>That's the end of the lesson.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Thank you! Sorry!</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>No permission form signed, no visiting the village.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>That's the rule, Potter.</td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>Those with permission, follow me.</td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>Those without, stay put.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I thought if you signed it, then I could...</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>I'm sorry, Potter.</td></tr><tr><td>MCGONAGALL</td><td>That's my final word.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Forget about it, guys. See you later.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Professor, can I ask you something?</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>I thought it'd be obvious.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I did think of Voldemort at first.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>I'm very impressed.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>This is very wise.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Before I fainted I heard something.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>A woman screaming.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Our pain becomes their power.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Not by your scar, by your eyes.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>They're your mother, Lily's.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>And your father, James, on the other hand he...</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You're more like them than you know, Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>In time, you'll come to see just how much.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>You heard it's the most...</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Haunted building in Britain. I know.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>What's going on?</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Probably Neville forgot the password again.</td></tr><tr><td>NEVILLE</td><td>Hey.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Oh, you're there.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Let me through, please.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Get back, all of you.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.</td></tr><tr><td>GINNY</td><td>The Fat Lady! She's gone!</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Serves her right.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>She was a terrible singer.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>It's not funny, Ron.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Back to your common room.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Be quiet. Make way.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>The headmaster's here.</td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>Come on, move.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>You heard. Move!</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.</td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>There's no need for ghosts, professor.</td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>The Fat Lady's there.</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Mind where you're going! Slow down!</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>You listen! I'm Head Boy!</td></tr><tr><td>PERCY</td><td>Come back here!</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Keep moving!</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Dear lady, who did this to you?</td></tr><tr><td>FAT LADY</td><td>Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.</td></tr><tr><td>FAT LADY</td><td>It's him, headmaster.</td></tr><tr><td>FAT LADY</td><td>The one they all talk about.</td></tr><tr><td>FAT LADY</td><td>He's here, somewhere in the castle!</td></tr><tr><td>FAT LADY</td><td>Sirius Black!</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>The rest of you, to the Great Hall.</td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. </td></tr><tr><td>FILCH</td><td>There's nothing there.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>TEACHER</td><td>The third floor's clear too, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Very good.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>I've done the dungeons.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>I didn't really expect him to linger.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Remarkable feat, don't you think?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Quite remarkable, yes.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Any theories on how he managed it?</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Many. Each as unlikely as the next.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>What about Potter?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Should he be warned?</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Turn to page 394.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Excuse me, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Where's Professor Lupin?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Turn to page 394.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Werewolves?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>We're not meant to start that for weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Quiet.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>When did she come in?</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Did you see her come in?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>No one?</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>How disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Please, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>A werewolf has no choice.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>He'd kill his best friend.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>He's got a point, you know.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Five points from Gryffindor.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>It's Quidditch tomorrow.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Loss of limb will not excuse you.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>Page 394.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>\"The term \"\"werewolf\"\" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word \"\"were\"\" which means \"\"man,\"\" and \"\"wolf.\"\" Werewolf, man-wolf.\"</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>There are several ways to become a werewolf.</td></tr><tr><td>SNAPE</td><td>They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...</td></tr><tr><td>CROWD</td><td>Go Go Gryffindor!!</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Go, Harry! Go, Harry!</td></tr><tr><td>DUMBLEDORE</td><td>Aresto momentum!</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>Peaky?</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>What do you expect?</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>He fell over 100 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>GEORGE</td><td>Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Probably a right sight better than he normally does.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>How are you feeling?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Oh, brilliant.</td></tr><tr><td>GEORGE</td><td>You gave us a right good scare.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>What happened?</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>Well, you fell off your broom.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Really? I meant the match. Who won?</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>No one blames you, Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.</td></tr><tr><td>HERMIONE</td><td>After he saved you, he sent them off.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>There's something else you should know too.</td></tr><tr><td>RON</td><td>When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...Well...</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Is there no chance of fixing it?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>No.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I mean, more than everyone else?</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Listen.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You are not weak, Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>You have nothing to be ashamed of.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I'm scared, professor.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I need to know how to fight them.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>You could teach me.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>You made the one on the train go away.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>There was only one that night.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>But you made it go away.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>But after the holidays.</td></tr><tr><td>LUPIN</td><td>For now, I need to rest.</td></tr><tr><td>MAN</td><td>Last call for Hogsmeade!</td></tr><tr><td>MAN</td><td>Come on, now!</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Guys, let me go.</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>Clever, Harry.</td></tr><tr><td>GEORGE</td><td>But not clever enough.</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>We've got a better way.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.</td></tr><tr><td>FRED & GEORGE</td><td>We know.</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>We'll get you there.</td></tr><tr><td>GEORGE</td><td>We'll show you a quicker way.</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>If you pipe down.</td></tr><tr><td>FRED</td><td>Bless him.</td></tr><tr><td>HARRY</td><td>Let me go!

no, definitely not.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>no matter.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>i wonder.. curious.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>very curious.</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>sorry, but what's curious?</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>i remember every wand i've ever sold, mr. potter.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>just one other.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>it is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. </td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>and who owned that wand?</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>we do not speak his name.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>the wand chooses the wizard, mr. potter.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>it's not always clear why.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>but i think it is clear that we can expect great things from you.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>after all, he-who-must-not-be-named did great things.</td></tr><tr><td>ollivander</td><td>terrible yes, but great</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>harry! harry!</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>happy birthday.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>you all right, harry?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>you seem very

</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>i know you do.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>first, and understand this harry because it's very important:</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>not all wizards are good.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>some of them go bad.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>a few years ago there was a one wizard who went as bad as he can go.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td> his name was v...</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>his name was v...</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>maybe if you wrote it down?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>no, i can't spell it.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>all right, voldemort.</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>voldemort?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>it was dark times, harry. dark times.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>voldemort started to gather some followers.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>brought them over to the dark side.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>your parents fought against him.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>but nobody lived once he decided to kill them.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>nobody, not one.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>except you.</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>me? voldemort tried to kill me?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>yes. that ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, harry.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>a mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>what happened to v...?</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>to you-know-who?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>well, some say he died.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>codswallop, in my opinion.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>nope, i reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>but one thing's absolutely certain. </td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>something about you stumped him that night.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>that's why you're famous.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>that's why everybody knows your name.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>you're the boy who lived.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>what are you looking at?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>blimey, is that the time?</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>sorry, harry, i'm gonna have to leave you.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>dumbledore will be wanting his...</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>well, he'll be wanting to see me.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.</td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>here's your ticket. </td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>stick to it, harry that's very important. </td></tr><tr><td>hagrid</td><td>stick to your ticket.</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>platform 9

you?</td></tr><tr><td>ron</td><td>this is scabbers, by the way.</td></tr><tr><td>ron</td><td>pathetic, isn't he?</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>just a little bit.</td></tr><tr><td>ron</td><td>fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow.</td></tr><tr><td>ron</td><td>want to see?</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>yeah.</td></tr><tr><td>hermione</td><td>has anyone seen a

blood.</td></tr><tr><td>hermione</td><td>blood?</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>listen, last night, i'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. </td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>but, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.</td></tr><tr><td>hermione</td><td> but why would anyone go near that dog?</td></tr><tr><td>harry</td><td>the day i
